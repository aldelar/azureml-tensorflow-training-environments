    "## Introduction\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to train a simple deep neural network using the MNIST dataset and Keras on Azure Machine Learning. MNIST is a popular dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images. Each image is a handwritten digit of `28x28` pixels, representing number from 0 to 9. The goal is to create a multi-class classifier to identify the digit each image represents, and deploy it as a web service in Azure.\n",

    "As the Run is executed, it will go through the following stages:\n",
    "1. Preparing: A docker image is created matching the Python environment specified by the Azure ML environment, and it will be uploaded to the workspace's Azure Container Registry. This step will only happen once for each Python environment -- the container will then be cached for subsequent runs. Creating and uploading the image takes about **5 minutes**. While the job is preparing, logs are streamed to the run history and can be viewed to monitor the progress of the image creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scaling: If the compute needs to be scaled up (i.e. the AmlCompute cluster requires more nodes to execute the run than currently available), the cluster will attempt to scale up in order to make the required amount of nodes available. Scaling typically takes about **5 minutes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Running: All scripts in the script folder are uploaded to the compute target, data stores are mounted/copied and the `entry_script` is executed. While the job is running, stdout and the `./logs` folder are streamed to the run history and can be viewed to monitor the progress of the run.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Post-Processing: The `./outputs` folder of the run is copied over to the run history\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to check the progress of a running job. We can use a Jupyter notebook widget. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: The widget will automatically update ever 10-15 seconds, always showing you the most up-to-date information about the run**"
